# Simulation-of-parking-guidance-strategies
Guidelines for performing simulations.
In order to run the simulations it is necessary to run the run.py script present in each folder.
Once a simulation is launched, all the steps will be displayed up to the end of the simulation.
At the end of the simulation, it is necessary to wait for the execution of the script to finish.
To generate the final results, you need to run the generatecsv.py script
To change the parking capacity as a percentage, open the setcapacity.py script in the Python-scripts folder and change the parameter as a percentage as the user prefers.
The simulation results will be present in the Outputs folder, those already present concern the parking time for the case of 100% capacity, while for the other cases they concern the distance traveled in meters.



NB you need to change the path of the files in each script
